Practical 1:

a) OSPF MD5 authentication. 
MD5 or Message-Digest Algorithm authentication is basically hashing algorithm like password to encrypt.
Only Perform Command:-

Go to Router 0 -> Then go in CLI -> go in config mode -> simply right r1#config -> then it is come in config mode -> 
Then write -> router ospf 1 Heat Enter -> area 0 authentication message-digest Heat Enter -> Then one time ex ->
interface s0/0/0 Heat Enter -> ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 aryan Heat Enter.
Same Step in Router 1 -> s0/0/1 and Router 2 -> s0/0/1.

How we can after adding this command whether it is successfully conneced or not.
We can full exit -> Then Write one command -> r1> show ip ospf interface Heat Enter -> There are lots of details come in cli then it SuccessFully Con.
Same R1 and R2.

Part 1 is done -> All 3 routers are completed hashing part means password are stored -> OPEN SHORTEST PATH FIRST it is used in to password strored in excrypt form.
It is  finding the shortest root to add the password.




b) Configuring NTP.
NTP means we can set the time, NTP stand for Network Time Protocal.
In R0 cli -> r1# show clock
In R1 cli -> r1# show clock
In R2 cli -> r1# show clock

How we can check NTP Time Steps we can follow:-
r0>en
r0#show clock
r0#config
r0(config)#ntp server 192.168.1.5
r0(config)#ntp update-calendar
r0(config)#ntp authenticate
r0(config)#ntp trusted-key 1
r0(config)#ntp authentication-key 1 md5 aryan
Above step set the clock Let's Check the clock.

r0#show clock
When We instantly time it is not showing the time we can go in topology and click in fast forward.



c) To Log Messages To The Syslog Server. 
Central Repository store the data like GitHub, We can push the data and store CD.

How can i perform this practical :-
Go in router -> Go in CLI -> r1>en -> r1#config -> r1(config)#service timestamps log datetime msec -> logging host 192.168.1.5 -> r1(config)#ex.
Complete this is the simply we can share the data in Syslog.
